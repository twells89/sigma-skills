# Report Validation

Validation has four separate gates. None substitutes for another.

## 1. Offline representation validation

```bash
ruby scripts/validate-spec.rb --mode create /tmp/report-spec.json
ruby scripts/validate-spec.rb --mode update /tmp/report-put.json
```

The validator checks:

- create or update wrapper shape;
- required document fields and `kind: report`;
- page, panel, and element IDs;
- 1,000-page and 10,000-pixel limits;
- panel types, page assignments, and one-header/one-footer per page;
- documented unsupported, workbook-only, schema-only, and unknown kinds;
- real XML parsing of Page, Panel, and Element layout nodes;
- absolute numeric coordinates and dimensions;
- page and panel outer bounds;
- exact one-time placement of every element;
- matching layout roots for pages and panels;
- rejection of workbook grid/container syntax.

Warnings are not proof of safety. Resolve schema-only or unknown kinds through
a targeted OpenAPI review and live verify before writing.

## 2. Server verify

POST the create envelope to `/v2/reports/spec/verify`. This is non-persistent
and should precede every create or update. For an update, wrap the edited
document with the current report name and folder solely for verification, then
send only `{document: ...}` to PUT.

Verify can catch schema and dependency errors that an offline validator cannot.

## 3. Readback and loss detection

After every persistent write, GET the report representation and compare:

- all element, page, and panel IDs;
- sources, columns, formulas, formats, and filters;
- layout coordinates and dimensions;
- report page configuration;
- panel assignments and heights;
- fields that the service normalized or dropped.

Before updating an existing report, compare the GET representation with page,
element, and control inventory endpoints. A feature present in inventory but
absent from the code representation is a destructive-update risk.

## 4. PDF and data parity

Export the affected report to PDF and inspect:

- clipping and overlap;
- page breaks and page count;
- margins, bleed, and whitespace;
- repeating header/footer placement;
- fonts, colors, images, and chart legends;
- table row continuation and totals;
- control/filter effects;
- representative values and aggregates against the warehouse.

API success cannot prove visual or data parity.

## Common failures

| Failure | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `document.kind must be report` | A workbook document was sent to a report endpoint. |
| element missing from layout | Add one `<Element elementId="...">` under a Page or Panel root. |
| undeclared element in layout | Fix the ID or add the literal element to `document.elements`. |
| workbook grid attribute | Replace grid syntax with pixel `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. |
| panel type mismatch | Make layout and metadata both `header` or both `footer`. |
| field disappears on GET | Treat readback as lossy; do not blindly PUT the result. |
| verify succeeds but PDF is wrong | Fix physical layout; verify is not a render test. |
