# Controls

Recipe book for the control element family and the patterns that wire them up. The OpenAPI is the source of truth for every field; this file adds the wiring patterns it doesn't teach.

Controls are interactive filter elements — lists, date pickers, text inputs, sliders, etc. They live in the page's `elements` array alongside tables and charts, **not** nested inside them. The wiring (which column a control filters, which downstream elements respond) is the part the OpenAPI doesn't teach — that's what this file is for.

**Every `controlType` wires up the same way** (`controlId` + `filters`, below); they differ only in the widget and its (flat top-level) value fields. So treat the per-type sections below as illustrations of the *wiring*, **not a catalog of what's supported** — a `controlType` you don't see here works the same way. The set also grows over time, so get the current list from the spec rather than hardcoding it:

```bash
jq -r '[.. | objects | select(.properties?.controlType?.enum) | .properties.controlType.enum[0]] | unique[]' /tmp/sigma-api.json
```

## Control Element Fields

A `control` element has exactly these fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | yes | Always `control` |
| `id` | yes | Element ID — must be unique on the page |
| `controlId` | yes | Formula reference name (e.g., `RegionFilter`) — keep distinct from `id`. This is the human-meaningful handle used when referring to the control's value from formulas. |
| `controlType` | yes | Any value the recipe above returns. Determines the widget and filter behavior. |
| `filters` | — | Array of `{ source, columnId }` — connects the control to the column(s) it filters. `source` is `{ kind: table, elementId: ... }`. |
| `source` | list/segmented | Where the widget's VALUE LIST comes from. Double-nested: `{ kind: source, source: { kind: table, elementId: ... }, columnId: ... }`. |
| `mode` | list | `include` \| `exclude`. **Flat top-level field.** |
| `selectionMode` | list | `single` \| `multiple`. **Flat top-level field.** |
| `values` | list | Default selection (`[]` = all). **Flat top-level field.** |
| `parameters` | — | Array, for binding the control to a data-model control (parameter). |
| `name` | — | Display label. |
| `style` | — | Presentation options for the widget. |

The value/widget fields (`mode`, `selectionMode`, `values`, range bounds, etc.) are **flat top-level siblings of `controlType`**, NOT nested in a separate "value object" — verified against a live workbook 2026-06-15. Different `controlType`s carry different value fields (the per-type recipes below show which), but they are always flat. Omitting them — or nesting them — yields the opaque `Invalid kind: control` rejection.

`filters[]` items are `{ source: { kind: table, elementId: ... }, columnId: ... }`. The `columnId` is the column on the target element to filter.

## List

A single- or multi-select list control over a column's values.

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-region          # element id — distinct from controlId
controlId: region        # formula handle
name: Store region
controlType: list
mode: include            # include | exclude   (TOP-LEVEL, not nested)
selectionMode: multiple  # single | multiple   (TOP-LEVEL)
values: []               # default selection, [] = all   (TOP-LEVEL)
source:                  # where the control's VALUE LIST comes from (note the double nesting)
  kind: source
  source:
    kind: table
    elementId: sales-master
  columnId: col-region
filters:                 # the TARGETS it filters — one entry per element+column it controls
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-by-region
    columnId: scoped-col-region
```

> **Verified working shape** (pulled from a live, successfully-POSTed workbook 2026-06-15). A list control carries `source` / `mode` / `selectionMode` / `values` as **flat top-level siblings** — NOT inside a nested "value object." The single most common mistake is omitting `source`/`mode`/`selectionMode`/`values` (or nesting them); Sigma then rejects the element with the opaque catch-all `Invalid kind: control`, which means **the inner fields are wrong, NOT that controls are unsupported** (see `reference/workflows/validate.md`). `segmented` and `hierarchy` are the other list-style widgets — same wiring (value-list `source` + `filters` targets).

## Date Range

A date-range control filters one or more date columns. The widget shape is determined by `mode`, and each mode takes different additional fields — all of them **flat top-level siblings of `controlType`** (verified against a live workbook 2026-06-15; a nested `value:{mode,unit}` object is rejected with `Invalid kind: control`). No `source` is needed — the column is defined by the `filters` binding.

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-date
controlId: DateFilter
name: Date range
controlType: date-range
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-table
    columnId: col-date
```

`mode` and its parameters are flat top-level fields. `includeNulls`: `always` | `never` | `when-no-value-is-selected`.

### Modes

| Mode | Extra fields | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `between` | `startDate?`, `endDate?` (ISO 8601) | Inclusive range. Both fields optional — omitting them shows the picker with no preset. |
| `last` | `value` (number), `unit`, `includeToday` (bool) | "Last N days/weeks/months." |
| `next` | `value`, `unit`, `includeToday` | "Next N days/weeks/months." |
| `current` | `unit` | "This year/quarter/month/week/day." |
| `on` | `date` (ISO 8601) | Exact date match. |
| `before` | `date` | Strictly before a fixed date. |
| `after` | `date` | Strictly after a fixed date. |
| `custom` | `startDate`, `endDate` (each: ISO string OR `{ op, unit, value }` for relative) | Mixed fixed/relative bounds. |

`unit` values: `year`, `quarter`, `month`, `week-starting-sunday`, `week-starting-monday`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`.

For relative `startDate` / `endDate` shapes (used in `custom` mode):

```yaml
op: now-minus
unit: day
value: 30
```

`op`: `now-minus` or `now-plus`.

### Mode Examples

These show the flat fields each `mode` carries — all top-level siblings of `controlType` (shown without the wrapping control element for brevity).

**Last 70 days:**

```yaml
mode: last
value: 70
unit: day
includeToday: true
```

**This quarter:**

```yaml
mode: current
unit: quarter
```

**Fixed range:**

```yaml
mode: between
startDate: "2026-01-01"
endDate: "2026-03-31"
```

**Last 90 days through today (custom mode with relative bounds):**

```yaml
mode: custom
startDate:
  op: now-minus
  unit: day
  value: 90
endDate:
  op: now-minus
  unit: day
  value: 0
```

## Text

Single-line text filter. (`text-area` is the multi-line variant — same wiring, different widget.)

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-search
controlId: SearchText
name: Search
controlType: text
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-table
    columnId: col-product-name
```

The text control carries the match `mode` and the search string as flat top-level fields. `mode` values include `equals`, `does-not-equal`, `contains`, `does-not-contain`, `starts-with`, `ends-with`, `like`, `matches-regexp`, and their negations.

## Number Range

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-amount
controlId: AmountFilter
name: Amount
controlType: number-range
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-table
    columnId: col-amount
```

The number-range control expresses the bounds with flat top-level `low`, `high`, and an optional `step` — **not** a positional `values: [min, max]` array and **not** a nested value object.

## Sliders

`slider` and `range-slider` are both first-class `controlType` values — distinct from `number` and `number-range`. A `slider` is a single-handle widget; `range-slider` has two handles for a low/high band. The bounds and value are **flat top-level fields** (verified against a live, UI-built workbook and a successful POST, 2026-06-15) — there is no value object.

A **single-handle `slider`** carries the track bounds (`low`/`high`), a `mode` comparator describing which rows the handle keeps, and a **scalar** `value` for the handle position:

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-deal-size
controlId: DealSize
name: Deal size
controlType: slider
low: 0
high: 100000
mode: "<="          # comparator: <= | >= | = | < | > — rows kept relative to the handle
value: 33755        # scalar handle position (FLAT — not a value object)
includeNulls: when-no-value-is-selected
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-table
    columnId: col-amount
```

A **`range-slider`** drops the scalar `value`/`mode` and uses the two-handle `low`/`high` band:

```yaml
controlType: range-slider
low: 0
high: 100000        # flat low/high band; no scalar value
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: sales-table
    columnId: col-amount
```

> A nested `value:{low,high}` object is rejected with `Invalid kind: control`. The most common slider mistake is omitting `mode` — without the comparator the element is rejected even though `low`/`high`/`value` are present.

## Single-value types

`number`, `date`, `checkbox`, and `switch` are single-value controls. `checkbox` and `switch` are the boolean widgets — same value (a boolean), different presentation:

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-active-only
controlId: ActiveOnly
name: Active only
controlType: switch
filters:
  - source:
      kind: table
      elementId: users-table
    columnId: col-is-active
```

## Top-N

`top-n` is a dedicated control type for "show the top N" interactions. Wire it like any other control via `filters`; the cap is a flat top-level field.

---

## One Control, Multiple Elements

A control's `filters` array can hold **multiple bindings** — one per element/column the control should filter. This is the right tool for a page-level filter that applies to several tables or charts at once. Don't make a separate control per element.

```yaml
kind: control
id: ctrl-region
controlId: RegionFilter
name: Store region
controlType: list
filters:
  - source: { kind: table, elementId: sales-table }
    columnId: col-region
  - source: { kind: table, elementId: returns-table }
    columnId: col-region
  - source: { kind: table, elementId: sales-by-region }
    columnId: col-region
```

Each binding names the target element by `elementId` and the column on that element to filter by `columnId`. The column IDs do **not** need to match across elements; they just need to exist on each target element.

## One Element, Multiple Controls

The dual pattern, and a common Sigma layout: a parent table that several controls filter, with downstream elements (KPIs, charts, secondary tables) sourcing from the parent. Filter once at the parent — every element that sources it inherits the filter automatically.

```yaml
# Parent: "sales-table". Downstream KPIs/charts source from it.
# Three controls each filter the parent on a different column.

- kind: control
  id: ctrl-region
  controlId: RegionFilter
  controlType: list
  filters:
    - source: { kind: table, elementId: sales-table }
      columnId: col-region

- kind: control
  id: ctrl-date
  controlId: DateFilter
  controlType: date-range
  filters:
    - source: { kind: table, elementId: sales-table }
      columnId: col-date

- kind: control
  id: ctrl-amount
  controlId: AmountFilter
  controlType: number-range
  filters:
    - source: { kind: table, elementId: sales-table }
      columnId: col-amount
```

Multiple controls on the same target compose with **AND** — selecting region "West" + date "Q1" narrows to the intersection. Prefer this over binding each control to every downstream element; it's less repetitive and keeps the filter chain in one place.

## Tip: `controlId` vs `id`

They are not the same and both are required:
- `id` is the element ID used internally and in `layout.md`.
- `controlId` is a human-facing handle used when referring to this control's value from formulas or downstream logic. Pick it to be meaningful (e.g., `RegionFilter`, `DateRange`).
