# Layout

Recipe book for the top-level `layout` XML — when to write it, the two-tag grammar, and the silent-failure traps to watch for. **Default to writing explicit `layout` XML for multi-element workbooks.**

> ⚠️ **`layout` is a sibling of `pages` — NOT a property nested under a page.** Its value is one XML string containing one `<Page id="…">` block per page (the `id` ties each block to a `pages[].id`). Putting `layout:` *inside* a `pages[]` entry is **silently ignored**: POST/PUT still returns `success: true`, but Sigma discards it and auto-arranges every page into a single stacked column. Verified 2026-06-16 — when correctly placed alongside `pages` it applies on both `POST` (create) and `PUT`; when nested under a page it's dropped on both. The failure is invisible until you render the page or GET the spec back: a readback that shows self-closing `<GridContainer .../>` tags with the children hoisted out as stacked siblings (and every element spanning `1 / 13`) means your authored layout was discarded. **Where `pages`/`layout` live has moved (2026-08-04 correction):** live create/verify now nests both inside a `document` wrapper (`document: {schemaVersion, kind, pages, layout}`), with only `name`/`folderId` staying outside it — not flat top-level siblings of `name`/`folderId` as this note previously said. See `reference/workflows/validate.md` §1 for the full story. See `schema.md` for the top-level object shape.

Container *elements* (the `kind: "container"` JSON placeholders that pair with `<GridContainer>` in this XML) are covered in **Container elements** below.

## When to write layout vs. let Sigma auto-arrange

Write explicit `layout` when **any** of these apply:

- The page has **mixed element kinds** (charts + KPIs, controls + charts, text/image/divider polish). Auto-arrange treats them as a vertical stack and gives every element the same height — KPIs end up the size of charts, dividers get huge gutters around them.
- The user asked for specific positioning ("logo on left, title on right", "KPIs across the top", side-by-side charts).
- There's a `kind: "container"` element on the page. Containers without a matching `<GridContainer>` are functionally no-ops.
- The workbook has more than ~4 elements on a page. Auto-arrange becomes a long scroll.

Auto-arrange (omit `layout`) is fine when:

- The page has a single element.
- The page is a uniform stack of tables — auto-arrange produces a reasonable list view.
- The user explicitly says default layout is fine.

If unsure, write the layout. Writing one is cheap (the patterns below are copy-paste); a visually broken dashboard is expensive.

## Two-tag grammar

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Page type="grid" gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto" id="<pageId>">
  <GridContainer elementId="<containerId>" type="grid" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 4"
                 gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
    <LayoutElement elementId="<childId>" gridColumn="1 / 13" gridRow="1 / 4"/>
  </GridContainer>
  <LayoutElement elementId="<elementId>" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="4 / 16"/>
</Page>
```

Each `<Page id>` matches a `pages[].id`. Each `elementId` matches an element on that page. `gridColumn` / `gridRow` use standard CSS grid line syntax (`start / end`); the default grid is 24 columns wide. One `<Page>` block per workbook page.

## `<GridContainer>` vs `<LayoutElement>`

- `<LayoutElement elementId="X" .../>` — **leaf**. Positions a single element; no children.
- `<GridContainer elementId="X" ...>...</GridContainer>` — **container**. Wraps child `<LayoutElement>`s in its own inner grid.

Use `<GridContainer>` for any tag with nested children — a `<LayoutElement>` only renders as a leaf.

## Container elements

A `kind: "container"` element in `pages[].elements[]` is a grouping placeholder — a labeled section, a branded header strip, a KPI row treated as a unit. It renders **only** when a matching `<GridContainer elementId="…">` positions it; declared without one, it's a no-op. Containers carry optional `style` (background color, border, corner radius, padding) and `backgroundImage` — pull the current shape from the spec rather than hardcoding it (the set of container/layout options is growing):

```bash
jq --arg k container 'first(.. | objects | select((.allOf? and any(.allOf[]?; .properties?.kind?.enum==[$k])) or .properties?.kind?.enum==[$k]))' /tmp/sigma-api.json
```

```yaml
- id: header
  kind: container
  style: { backgroundColor: "#0B3D91" }
```

- **Element on a background image:** to place an element *on top of* a container's `backgroundImage`, make it a **child** of that container in the layout XML — the background spans the container and the child sits on top.
- **When to skip:** with no shared background or logical grouping, position elements directly with `<LayoutElement>`. A container around a single element is usually overkill.

### Repeated containers are **not** spec-authorable (UI only)

A **repeated container** — one card or list row that repeats once per row of a source element, with child text/images bound to that row's columns — is a real and heavily-used Sigma UI feature. **It cannot be created, or preserved, through the spec API.** Verified 2026-08-05:

- The `container` element schema has exactly **four** properties: `id`, `kind`, `style`, `backgroundImage`. There is no source binding, no repeat/`repeatFrom` field, and no child list. (`wb-rep.rb capabilities --kind container` confirms.)
- Nothing in the compiled OpenAPI exposes repetition on a container. Every `"repeat"` string in the whole spec is the background-image **tiling** value (`repeat`), unrelated to repeated containers.
- A speculative `repeatFrom` on a container **passed `/verify` and the real create, then came back absent** from `GET .../spec` — the classic silent drop. `/verify` accepting a field is not evidence the field exists.

**The dangerous part is the read direction.** `GET /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec` on a workbook that *does* contain repeated containers **silently drops them**, leaving behind child elements whose formulas reference an element that no longer exists anywhere in the spec — e.g. `{{[Base Notifications repeated container/Title]}}` with no `Base Notifications repeated container` declared in `pages[].elements[]`. Consequences:

- **Never treat such a GET-back as a faithful copy.** Re-POSTing it produces a workbook with dangling references and missing cards, not a clone.
- **Don't "clone a repeated container" from a captured spec** — the repeat wiring was never in the file to clone. Bindings like `{{[Source/Column]}}` do round-trip; the *repeat* that gives them per-row meaning does not.
- If a spec you're editing contains `{{[X/Col]}}` references to an undeclared element, suspect a dropped repeated container rather than a typo, and expect to rebuild that region in the UI.

When a request needs repeated cards, say so during planning and offer a spec-authorable substitute: a `table` with `conditionalFormats`, or a fixed set of hand-placed KPI/text elements when the row count is small and stable.

## Tabbed containers

A `kind: "tabbed-container"` element packs several views into one region — switchable tabs instead of a long vertical scroll or extra pages. Unlike the `kind: "container"` placeholder above, it's a real element with its own JSON shape, not a bare grouping wrapper.

**It IS spec-authorable** — verified working end-to-end via spec `POST`/`PUT`, not the UI-only construct a stale note elsewhere may claim.

**JSON element** (`pages[].elements[]`) — `tabs[]` entries are **labels only**, no children:

```yaml
- id: tc
  kind: tabbed-container
  tabs:
    - name: Overview
    - name: Detail
  tabBar:
    alignment: start
```

The actual content for each tab is ordinary elements declared elsewhere in `pages[].elements[]` — the layout XML below is what places them into a tab.

**Layout XML** — a `<TabbedContainer>` wraps one `<Tab>` per label. `<Tab>` children map to `tabs[]` **by position** (1st `<Tab>` = 1st label; `<Tab>` carries no `name` attribute):

```xml
<TabbedContainer elementId="tc" type="tabbed-container" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="7 / 60">
  <Tab gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
    <LayoutElement elementId="overview-chart" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 12"/>
  </Tab>
  <Tab gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
    <LayoutElement elementId="detail-table" gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 12"/>
  </Tab>
</TabbedContainer>
```

Two `<Tab>`s, two elements (`overview-chart`, `detail-table`) each declared once in `pages[].elements[]`; `<Tab>` order alone ties them to the "Overview" / "Detail" labels above.

- **Gotcha (verified):** inside a `<Tab>`, use **bare `<LayoutElement>` children only** — never nest a `<GridContainer>` inside a `<Tab>`. A `<Tab>` is already a mini-grid (its own `gridTemplateColumns` / `gridTemplateRows`), so elements position directly in it; a nested `<GridContainer>` scrambles tab render order.
- **When to use it:** several views that are alternates of each other (a summary + a detail table, one view per region/segment) rather than sequential reading — pack them into one region instead of a long scroll or extra pages.
- **Building it:** hand-authoring the position-mapped `<Tab>` block is error-prone. Use `Composition.tabbed_container(id:, tabs:, grid_column:, grid_row:, tab_bar_alignment: 'start')` in `scripts/lib/composition.rb` — `tabs:` is `[{name:, inner:}]`, where `inner` is the tab's bare-`<LayoutElement>` XML (built with `Composition.band`/`Composition.le` or by hand). It returns `{element:, layout:}`, ready to splice into `pages[].elements[]` and the workbook-level `layout` string.

## `gridTemplateRows`: always `"auto"`

Row tracks are always `"auto"` — write `gridTemplateRows="auto"`. Height comes from the children, not from the row track.

### Stacking children inside a container

Because row tracks collapse to `"auto"`, height comes from children, not from the container's `gridTemplateRows`. Two patterns work:

**Side-by-side** — children share the container's row range, differ by `gridColumn`:

```xml
<GridContainer elementId="kpi-row" type="grid"
               gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 4"
               gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-1" gridColumn="1 / 9"  gridRow="1 / 4"/>
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-2" gridColumn="9 / 17" gridRow="1 / 4"/>
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-3" gridColumn="17 / 25" gridRow="1 / 4"/>
</GridContainer>
```

**Stacked rows** — children have disjoint `gridRow` spans within the container's row range:

```xml
<GridContainer elementId="header-row" type="grid"
               gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 12"
               gridTemplateColumns="repeat(24, 1fr)" gridTemplateRows="auto">
  <LayoutElement elementId="title"  gridColumn="1 / 25" gridRow="1 / 4"/>
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-1"  gridColumn="1 / 9"  gridRow="4 / 12"/>
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-2"  gridColumn="9 / 17" gridRow="4 / 12"/>
  <LayoutElement elementId="kpi-3"  gridColumn="17 / 25" gridRow="4 / 12"/>
</GridContainer>
```

Use stacked rows when you want a section header above a row of charts inside the same container, instead of moving those elements out to the page level.

## Element height heuristics — give tables room to breathe

A table element's `gridRow` span controls how many data rows are visible before it scrolls. The recurring mistake is **under-sizing tables** — a detail/raw-row table given a 5–8 row span shows only ~2 data rows, which defeats the point of a "see the underlying data" table. Size by role:

- **Detail / raw-row tables** (the bottom-of-page "drill into the data" table): give a **tall** span — **~14–20 grid rows** (e.g. `gridRow="32 / 50"`). The user should see 6–10+ rows without scrolling. When a detail table is the last element on the page, err on the side of *too tall* — trailing whitespace below it is cheaper than a cramped 2-row table.
- **Summary / aggregated tables** (a handful of grouped rows): size to roughly the row count + header, ~6–10 grid rows.
- **KPIs**: short — ~5–6 rows; they're a single number.
- **Charts**: ~8–12 rows so axes and labels aren't crushed.

Heights are relative grid units (tracks are `auto`), so these are rules of thumb, not pixels — but the asymmetry holds: **tables are the element most often made too short.** If you're unsure, render the page (PNG export) and count visible rows.

## Page-level fields: `visibility` and `backgroundImage`

Besides `id`, `name`, and `elements` — and the workbook-top-level `layout` XML whose `<Page id>` block references this page's elements (see the top of this doc; `layout` is NOT a page field) — a page supports two optional fields:

- **`visibility`** — set to `hidden` to hide the page from end users. Omit for a visible page.
- **`backgroundImage`** — a page-wide background image, same shape as a container's `backgroundImage`: a required `url` plus an optional `style` block (`fit`, `horizontalAlign`, `verticalAlign`, `tiling`). `url` supports `{{formula}}` references.

```yaml
pages:
  - id: overview
    name: Overview
    visibility: hidden
    backgroundImage:
      url: https://cdn.example.com/bg.jpg
      style:
        fit: cover
        tiling: none
    elements: [ ... ]
```

## Layout `elementId` references

Each layout `elementId` must match an element `id` on that page exactly (case-sensitive). IDs are preserved verbatim on create, so the IDs in your saved spec stay valid for follow-up `PUT`s.

To study real grid-container idioms, fetch an existing multi-page workbook's spec (`GET /v2/workbooks/{id}/spec`, see SKILL.md Steps 1–2). The OpenAPI doesn't model the `layout` XML string, so a live spec is the way to see production layout.
