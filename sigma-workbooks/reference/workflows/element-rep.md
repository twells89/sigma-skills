# Element-Level Workbook Rep (`scripts/wb-rep.rb`)

The spec API replaces a whole workbook document. The rep makes one flat
`document.elements[]` entry the editing unit while preserving metadata and
layout separately.

## File representation

```text
<rep>/
  workbook.yaml                 outer metadata + remaining document fields
  elements/
    010-revenue-kpi.yaml        one flat document.elements entry per file
    020-sales-by-region.yaml
  pages/
    010-overview/
      _page.yaml                page metadata only
      _layout.xml               matching <Page id="overview"> layout block
  overlays/
    010-detail/
      _overlay.yaml             modal/drawer metadata
      _layout.xml
  panels/
    010-sidebar/
      _panel.yaml               panel metadata
      _layout.xml
  renders/
  .sigma/
    manifest.yaml
    snapshot.yaml               canonical wrapped GET shape
    layout-preamble.xml
```

`workbook.yaml` mirrors the API wrapper:

```yaml
name: Sales
folderId: <folder-id>
document:
  schemaVersion: 1
  kind: workbook
  settings: { ... }
  agents: [...]
```

The split collections and layout are inserted beneath that `document` during
assembly. Elements never live beneath a page directory. Layout is the source of
truth for page/container/tab membership, so moving an element means editing
`_layout.xml`, not moving its YAML file.

## Commands

```bash
scripts/wb-rep.rb summarize <id|dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb pull <workbook-id> <dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb status <dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb push <dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb render <dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb render <dir> --page Overview
scripts/wb-rep.rb import <spec.yaml> <dir>
scripts/wb-rep.rb assemble <dir> -o out.yaml
scripts/wb-rep.rb verify <spec.yaml>
scripts/wb-rep.rb capabilities --kind bar-chart
```

`pull` and `import` accept the wrapped API shape. A legacy flat artifact can be
read and is normalized immediately to the wrapped representation.

`push`:

1. reassembles the wrapped spec;
2. checks remote drift;
3. previews metadata, layout, and element changes;
4. validates flat-element formulas and layout coverage;
5. POSTs the full create body or PUTs exactly `{document: {...}}`;
6. saves the canonical readback, including server normalization.

## Editing rules

- Add/delete an element in `elements/` and add/delete every corresponding
  `elementId` placement in layout.
- Reorder pages/overlays/panels by filename prefix. Element filename order is
  useful for review but does not establish page ownership.
- `_page.yaml`, `_overlay.yaml`, and `_panel.yaml` are metadata only.
- Every non-empty workbook must have explicit layout under this skill policy.
- Keep IDs stable. Cross-element formulas use element names, so update dependent
  formulas when renaming.
- PUT is full document replacement. Never remove `settings`, `agents`,
  `overlays`, or `panels` merely because the current edit does not touch them.

After a push, run compile verification and inspect rendered pages. A successful
write proves shape validity, not formula parity or visual correctness.
