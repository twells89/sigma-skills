# Planning apps — scenario-grain writeback pattern

Entered via [`generate-apps.md`](generate-apps.md) when the user asked to generate an app.

Use this pattern when a workbook is a model rather than only a report: actual
periods followed by forecast periods, assumption tables, budget/scenario
vocabulary, manual forecast cells, or review and approval.

Do not turn every dashboard into a planning app. Establish the requested mode:

1. **One working plan** — one editable forecast, no scenario comparison.
2. **Scenario planning** — isolated scenario copies, comparison, and status.
3. **Variance workflow** — actual-vs-plan annotations and approvals, without
   editable forecast values.
4. **Parity only** — preserve the verified analytical workbook.

The architecture below is for scenario planning.

## Non-negotiable grain

The editable table must have one row per:

```text
Scenario × Period × Planning Line
```

For an FP&A P&L this is usually:

```text
Scenario × Month × Line Item
```

A scenario metadata table alone is not scenario planning. If scenarios share
one plan grid, switching the selector changes only a label; every scenario
still edits the same values.

Write and later verify:

```text
expected rows = scenarios × forecast periods × planning lines
```

## Four-layer architecture

### 1. Governed baseline

Create a read-only table at forecast grain with stable context and the source
model's governed baseline:

```yaml
name: Plan Base
columns:
  - { id: pb-period,  formula: "[Source/Month]",     name: Month }
  - { id: pb-line,    formula: "[Source/Line Item]", name: Line Item }
  - { id: pb-section, formula: "[Source/Section]",   name: Section }
  - { id: pb-base,    formula: "<driver formula>",   name: Baseline }
  - { id: pb-key,     formula: "1",                  name: Join Key }
```

Preserve the source semantics: compounding drivers compound, manual lines stay
manual, and flat lines stay flat. Prove baseline parity before writeback.

### 2. Scenario directory

Use an empty input table for scenario metadata:

```yaml
id: scenarios
kind: input-table
inputMode: view
name: Scenarios
source: { kind: empty, connectionId: <write connection> }
columns:
  - { id: ID }
  - { id: sc-name,   type: text, name: Scenario Name }
  - { id: sc-status, type: text, name: Status,
      values: [Draft, In Review, Approved], pills: color-by-option }
  - { id: sc-owner,  type: text, name: Owner }
  - { id: sc-notes,  type: text, name: Notes }
```

Creating one scenario is an appropriate `insert-rows` action. Creating every
scenario-period-line row through actions is not.

Scenario strategy is descriptive unless explicit formulas implement it. Never
give scenarios different labels but identical math and imply the labels changed
the forecast.

### 3. Scenario matrix

Cross-join scenario rows to baseline rows with a constant key:

```yaml
name: Plan Matrix
source:
  kind: join
  name: Plan Matrix
  primarySource: { kind: table, elementId: scenario-directory }
  joins:
    - name: Base
      joinType: inner
      left:  { kind: table, elementId: scenario-directory }
      right: { kind: table, elementId: plan-base }
      columns:
        - { left: "[Join Key]", right: "[Join Key]" }
```

The join composes the required row grain; it does not populate the input table.
Verify:

```text
matrix rows = scenarios × baseline rows
```

If empty, inspect formula prefixes and ensure both constant keys share a type.

### 4. Linked plan grid

Link editable fields to the scenario matrix:

```yaml
id: plan-grid
kind: input-table
inputMode: view
name: Plan Grid
source:
  kind: linked
  from: plan-matrix
  connectionId: <write connection>
columns:
  - { id: pg-scenario, key: mx-scenario, name: Scenario }
  - { id: pg-period,   key: mx-period,   name: Period }
  - { id: pg-line,     key: mx-line,     name: Planning Line }
  - { id: pg-section,  key: mx-section,  name: Section }
  - { id: pg-baseline, key: mx-baseline, name: Baseline }
  - { id: pg-method, type: text, name: Method,
      values: ["Uplift %", "Adjust $", "Set amount"] }
  - { id: pg-percent, type: number, name: Uplift % }
  - { id: pg-dollars, type: number, name: Dollar Change }
  - { id: pg-new,     type: number, name: New Amount }
  - { id: pg-plan,   formula: "<method switch>", name: Plan Amount }
  - { id: pg-delta,  formula: "[Plan Amount] - [Baseline]", name: Plan Delta }
  - { id: pg-impact, formula: "<signed delta>", name: Profit Impact }
  - { id: pg-note, type: text, name: Rationale }
```

Bind inherited context as `{id, key}` columns. Cross-element formula columns
can render “multiple values” even after a successful POST/readback. Query rows
after data lands and prove each key resolves to one parent row.

Keys are immutable once the linked table exists. Key only deterministic, stable
context:

- good: scenario, period, planning line, section, governed baseline;
- bad: status, owner, current user, `Now()`, volatile lookup, approval state.

## Override semantics

Use labels that match the math. A row-level:

```text
Baseline × (1 + 10%)
```

is a 10% uplift to that row, not a monthly growth rate that compounds into
future periods.

```text
If Method = "Uplift %":
  Baseline × (1 + Uplift %)
Else if Method = "Adjust $":
  Baseline + Dollar Change
Else if Method = "Set amount":
  New Amount
Else:
  Baseline
```

Blank method means governed baseline. Do not pre-populate fake methods merely
to make the grid look active.

## Financial sign

P&L expense rows commonly store positive magnitudes, so raw delta is not
favorability:

```text
Plan Delta = Plan Amount - Baseline

Profit Impact =
  If Section = "Revenue":
    Plan Delta
  Else:
    -Plan Delta
```

Revenue +10 is favorable; expense +10 is unfavorable. Color Profit Impact,
not Plan Delta. If a conditional format that references its own formula column
silently no-ops, repeat the underlying expression in the condition and render
both positive and negative fixtures.

## Scenario selection and filter propagation

Any control filter attached to the plan grid propagates to all descendants.
Choose one design explicitly:

### Option A — complete grid, formula-scoped analytics

Do not target the grid with the scenario control. Sort by scenario and scope
selected analytics with formulas:

```text
Sum(If([Scenario] = [scenarioControl], [Amount], 0))
```

All-scenario comparisons remain intact, but the editable grid shows all
scenarios.

### Option B — filtered grid, independent all-scenario read path

Filter the grid to the active scenario. This improves editing but every
descendant loses unselected rows. Formula-scoped KPIs remain correct; a chart
intended to compare every scenario collapses to one.

Put all-scenario visuals on a lineage that does not descend from the filtered
grid, such as a supported warehouse view/read path, or replace them with an
active-scenario comparison. Never leave a one-bar “all scenarios” chart.

## Approval and audit

Generate-apps Step B asks whether this workflow needs approvals. If they
declined, keep the plan grid and omit the submit / status-update path
below.

Approval requires two writes:

1. append an immutable decision row;
2. update only the selected scenario's status.

Use the stable scenario key in `whichRows`, and prove another scenario remains
unchanged. Reset modal controls with ordered `set-control-value` effects after
the insert; see `actions.md`.

## Agent contract

Generate-apps Step B offers this agent and pre-fills the recommended
purpose; skip this section if they declined.

Give the agent the selected plan ledger, all-scenario comparison, plan grid,
scenario directory, and decision log. Instruct it to:

- distinguish actual, baseline, and selected plan;
- compare only scenario-keyed rows;
- use Profit Impact rather than raw Plan Delta for favorability;
- never claim a write occurred unless the user approved the action.

Validate with a question whose answer is known from an entered override.

## Manual published-view gate

Code Rep cannot enable published data entry. For every input table:

```text
element kebab → Set data entry permission → Only in published version
```

Publish and type in a real cell. The setting is absent from `GET /spec`.

## Required verification

POST/readback proves structure only. Before handoff, capture:

| Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Baseline parity | source-vs-Sigma periods and totals |
| Matrix cardinality | scenarios × baseline rows |
| Key correlation | one parent row per linked row |
| Scenario isolation | edit A; B stays baseline; A persists |
| Financial sign | revenue increase positive; expense increase negative |
| Selected KPI scope | active scenario changes; unselected edits excluded |
| Grid scope | matches declared Option A or B |
| All-scenario scope | every scenario remains where comparison is promised |
| Approval scope | selected status changes; another does not |
| Audit | time, user, scenario, decision, and comment persist |
| Published writeback | real edit succeeds outside draft |
| Visual | rendered pages contain no errors or misleading totals |
